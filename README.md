# Booki Travel Site

I completed this project during using HTML and CSS only. 

For this project, I was presented with an email from the company, desktop & mobile mock-ups, and a summary document with functional & technical specification. I recreated the mock-up images from scratch, as well as, a tablet version with no additional direction.
