Project #2 Web Development - Open Classrooms

I completed this project during the OpenClassrooms using HTML and CSS only. I coded it in VSCode and processed commits using Git via Linux on Windows with WSL. 

For this project, I was presented with an email from the Booki CTO, desktop & mobile mock-ups, and a summary document with functional & technical specification. I recreated the mock-up images from scratch, as well as, a tablet version with no additional direction.
